# STFbU

Shut the Facebook Up: a Chrome extension that removes Facebook Chat.

#### How do I install STFBU?

- Open up Chrome's extension page by typing `chrome://extensions` into your URL bar.

- Be sure the checkbox next to "Developer mode" is checked!

- Use the Download ZIP button on this page to get the archive.

- Unzip this archive. You should have one folder, probably named `stfbu-master`.

- Drag the folder into the extensions page until you see the Drop to Install note.

- Drop it.

#### How can I tell if it's working?

Visit Facebook using Chrome and notice that the chat sidebar isn't there any more.
